Music Genre Recognition using AI/ML
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the genre of a song based on its audio features. The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms to classify songs into predefined genres.

Project Description
Music genre classification is an exciting problem in the field of machine learning. In this project, we use audio features of music tracks (like tempo, spectral features, and rhythm) to build a classification model that predicts the genre of the song.

The project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Extracting relevant features from the audio files.

Model Training: Implementing machine learning algorithms to train a model for genre classification.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model with test data.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for this project.

Librosa: A Python package for analyzing and extracting features from audio signals.

Scikit-learn: A Python library for machine learning algorithms.

TensorFlow/Keras: If deep learning methods are used for classification.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and performance analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: For developing and testing the code.

Setup and Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Adity2203/Music_genres_recognition_usingAI-ML.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Music_genres_recognition_usingAI-ML
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run the following scripts:

Data Preprocessing: Run the script to preprocess the audio data and extract features.

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess_data.py
Train the Model: Use this command to train the machine learning model on the dataset.

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Make Predictions: After training the model, use it to predict the genre of a new song.

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict_genre.py --audio_file <path_to_audio_file>
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing consists of audio files from various genres. You can either use an existing dataset or upload your own music data. Some popular music genre datasets include:

GTZAN Genre Collection: A widely used dataset with 1000 audio clips across 10 genres.

FMA Dataset: A free music dataset for academic purposes.

Model Training
This project uses different machine learning algorithms for genre classification, including:

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The features extracted from the audio signals are used to train the models. The models are then evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
